## 🔐 Access Control Logic

### How Access is Determined:

```
1. User logs in
   ↓
2. System fetches user data from Firestore:
   - userType: "business" | "professional" | null
   - subscriptionPlan: "freemium" | "business" | "professional" | null
   ↓
3. For PAID SERVICES (CA Certificates, Legal Documents, etc.):
   
   Step 1: Get base price from pricing configuration
   Step 2: Check if service is FREE:
      IF (userType === "professional" AND subscriptionPlan === "professional")
      THEN effectivePrice = 0 (FREE)
      ELSE effectivePrice = basePrice (PAY)
   Step 3: Show payment gate or direct access
```

---

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Code Flow in Legal Documents (Example):

```typescript
// 1. Fetch user subscription info
const userSubscriptionInfo = await getUserSubscriptionInfo(user.uid);
// Returns: { userType: "professional", subscriptionPlan: "professional" }

// 2. Get base price from pricing service
const basePrice = pricing?.registration_deeds?.find(s => s.id === 'trust_deed')?.price || 0;
// Returns: 9999 (for Trust Deed)

// 3. Calculate effective price
const effectivePrice = getEffectiveServicePrice(
  basePrice,                                    // 9999
  userSubscriptionInfo.userType,               // "professional"
  userSubscriptionInfo.subscriptionPlan,       // "professional"
  "registration_deeds"                         // Service category
);
// Returns: 0 (FREE for professionals) or 9999 (PAY for others)

// 4. Show payment gate or direct access
if (effectivePrice > 0) {
  // Show CashfreeCheckout payment button
} else {
  // Show download button directly (FREE)
}
```

## 🛠️ How It Works Behind the Scenes

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **User Navigates to a Service Page**
   - Example: `/legal-documents/trust-deed`

2. **Page Loads and Fetches Data:**
   ```typescript
   // Fetch user authentication
   const [user] = useAuthState(auth);
   
   // Fetch user subscription info
   const userSubscriptionInfo = await getUserSubscriptionInfo(user.uid);
   // Returns: { userType: "professional", subscriptionPlan: "professional" }
   
   // Fetch pricing configuration
   const pricing = await getServicePricing();
   // Returns: { registration_deeds: [{ id: "trust_deed", price: 9999 }] }
   ```

3. **Calculate Effective Price:**
   ```typescript
   const basePrice = pricing.registration_deeds.find(s => s.id === 'trust_deed')?.price || 0;
   // basePrice = 9999
   
   const effectivePrice = getEffectiveServicePrice(
     basePrice,
     userSubscriptionInfo.userType,
     userSubscriptionInfo.subscriptionPlan,
     "registration_deeds"
   );
   // effectivePrice = 0 (FREE) for professionals
   // effectivePrice = 9999 (PAY) for others
   ```

4. **Render UI Based on Price:**
   ```typescript
   if (effectivePrice > 0) {
     // Show payment checkout
     <CashfreeCheckout amount={effectivePrice} ... />
   } else {
     // Show download button directly
     <ShareButtons contentRef={printRef} ... />
   }
   ```
